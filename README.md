# Meal-generator
[Maaltijdgenrator.rf.gd](http://www.maaltijdgenerator.rf.gd)

A website that chooses a meal randomly so you don't have to stress choosing what to eat today.

A rather simple html layout, and some kinda stylish css. This was my first javascript project that really worked. 

It is hosted by infinityfree.
