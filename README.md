# Meal-generator
[Maaltijdgenrator.rf.gd](http://www.maaltijdgenerator.rf.gd)

### Description
A website that chooses a meal randomly so you don't have to stress choosing what to eat today.
A rather simple html layout, and some kinda stylish css. This was my first javascript project that really worked.
It (sadly) is in dutch, as I know dutch meals and there ingedients etc a lot better

### Future plans
I would like to an database to store all the meals with their corresponding ingedients, allergies and method of preperation.
With the database users could add there own meals, and set them to public or private.
You should be able to select certain allergies that generated meals should not include.

It is hosted by infinityfree.
